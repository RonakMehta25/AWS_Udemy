AWS CLI Pagination

The default page size is 1000

So when you run command for S3 which has 2500 objects. It will make 3 API calls but displays entire output in one go.

Sometimes default page size of 1000 may be too high. It happens during API timeout error.

You can set page size when you run command with --page-size

The CLI will still retrieve the full list but will make large number of API call in the background and
retrieve small number of objects with each call.

aws s3api list-objects --bucket {myBucket} --page-size 100

we can use --max-items

aws s3api list-objects --bucket {myBucket} --max-items 100
