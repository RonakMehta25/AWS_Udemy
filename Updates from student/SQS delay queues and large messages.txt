SQS delay queues and large messages

Postpone delivery of new messages to delay queue by few seconds.

This means message become invisible for that number of seconds.

Default is 0 second and max is 900 seconds

Now for standard queue this doesn't impact messages in the queue . It only impacts new messages

For FIFO queue, it impacts all the messages.

This is usually used in large distributed application. Like for online transaction confirmation after database update.

For large messages> 256KB, messages are stored in S3.

For this , you need to use Amazon SQS extended client library for JAVA and AWS SDK for java.

You cannot do it from AWS CLI,management console or SQS API or any other AWS SDK.

SQS client library helps to specify if all messages are stored in S3 or greater than 256KB.

Also helps to specify message to send ,get or delete.
