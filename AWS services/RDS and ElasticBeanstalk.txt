RDS and ElasticBeanstalk

There are 2 ways of integration of RDS with ElasticBeanstalk

1. You can launch RDS instance from your elastic Beanstalk console which means RDS is created within your Elastic Beanstalk Environment. 
This is good option for Dev and Test environment.

2. For production environment, decouple RDS from elasticBeanstalk.
This gives lot of flexibility that allows you to connect multiple environment to the same database, provides wider range of database choices.

To do this, you need to add additional security group to your auto scaling group. You will need to provide additional connection string.
