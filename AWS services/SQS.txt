It is a web service that gives you access to message queue that can be used to store message queue while your computer processes data.

It is a distributed queue system that can be reliably store messages for one component to generate messages to be viewed by another component.It used to decouple the application.

Defauly rentention time is 4 days

Messages can be in Queue from 1 min to 14 Days

SQS is a pool based system.

2 types of queues :-

1. Standard Queues (Nearly unlimited number of transaction per second)
It can contain duplicates


2. FIFO Queues (300 Transaction per second)

Here duplicates are not allowed. It also supports Multiple Ordered Message Queue 


SQS visibility Timeout.
The time for which message become invisible after reader picks it up.
If the job is processed successfully after picking the messages , queue deletes the message .

If the job is not processed successfully then message becomes available again and thus this can give duplicate messages.

Default visibility timeout is 30 seconds
Maximum is 12 hours.

SQS long polling is a way to retrieve messages from AWS SQS 

There is short polling an long polling. Short polling returns empty if queue is empty 

But long polling returns when value arrives in SQS . Thus it saves your money.
