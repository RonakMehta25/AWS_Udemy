Lambda Execution Environment

There is control plane and data plane

Control plane can create Function Management API like New Function and update function code and manages integration with other AWS services.

Data plane looks afte function execution

When lambda function runs, data plane allocates execution environment or chooses existing execution environment.

Each execution environment hosts one concurrent invocation, but is reused in place across multiple serial invocations of the same function.

Execution environments run on hardware virtualized virtual machines(microVMs). 

A microVM is dedicated to an AWS account, but can be reused by execution environments across functions within an account. 

MicroVMs are packed onto an AWS owned and managed hardware platform (Lambda Workers). 

Execution environments are never shared across functions, and microVMs are never shared across AWS accounts.
