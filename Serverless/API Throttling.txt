API Throttling

By default , AWS limits steady state request rate to 10000 request/second.

Maximum concurrent request is 5000 request across all API within AWS account.

If you go over 10,000 request or 5000 concurrent request , you will get 429 too many request error.

Examples.

If you give 10000 request per second i.e 10 request per millisecond . AWS will process it without dropping any.

If you give 10000 request in first millisecond then AWS will process 5000 and drops rest 5000

If you give 5000 request in first millisecond and rest 5000 evenly distributed over rest 999 millisecond then AWS will process it successfully without dropping any.

We can update this throttling limits inside API gateway.
