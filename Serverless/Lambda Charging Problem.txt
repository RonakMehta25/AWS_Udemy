If you allocated 512MB of memory to your function, executed it 3 million times in one month, and it ran for 1 second each time, your charges would be calculated as follows:
Monthly compute charges

The monthly compute price is $0.00001667 per GB-s and the free tier provides 400,000 GB-s.

Total compute (seconds) = 3M * (1s) = 3,000,000 seconds

Total compute (GB-s) = 3,000,000 * 512MB/1024 = 1,500,000 GB-s

Total compute – Free tier compute = Monthly billable compute GB- s

1,500,000 GB-s – 400,000 free tier GB-s = 1,100,000 GB-s

Monthly compute charges = 1,100,000 * $0.00001667 = $18.34

 

Monthly request charges

The monthly request price is $0.20 per 1 million requests and the free tier provides 1M requests per month.
Total requests – Free tier requests = Monthly billable requests

3M requests – 1M free tier requests = 2M Monthly billable requests

Monthly request charges = 2M * $0.2/M = $0.40

 

Total monthly charges
Total charges = Compute charges + Request charges = $18.34 + $0.40 = $18.74 per month
