Alexa skill with Lambda

We use poly to convert text to speech mp3 file. This mp3 file is then stored in S3.

Then we create Alexa Code in Lambda by using Serverless repository.

Then go to amazon alexa console and point it to this lambda alexa.

For running audio in lambda code, add '<audio src="">' and src should be object URL.
