There are 2 deploymeny approaches available

1. In place
2. Blue/Green.

1. In place, Rolling.

Application is stopped in each instance and latest revision installed.
Thus application is out of service during this time and capacity is reduced.

2. Blue(old)/Green(green)

Here new instance are launched and code is deployed in new version and 

Thus when new version start working normally then old instances can be terminated.

Also in case of failure,new instance can be deleted and load balancer just needs to point to old instance.
