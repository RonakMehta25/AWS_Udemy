Docker and CodeBuild

Docker is open source tech which allow you to create application on windows or linux containers

Container is a light weight software package which includes everything a software needs to run like run code environment,library,settings etc.

docker build -t mydocker -- it builds docker image based on docker file.

docker tag mydocker:latest {URL} - tagging docker image as latest.

docker push {URL} - push to Elastic Container Service

buildspec.yml is used by code Build for settings and build commands

You can override the settings in your buildspec by adding your own commands when you launch the build

If the build fails, you can watch build log in codebuild console and entire long in cloud watch.
