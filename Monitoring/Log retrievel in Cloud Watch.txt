Log retrievel in Cloud Watch

Log data are retrieved by GetMetricsStatistics API or by using third party tools offered by AWS partners.

Data are persisted indefinitely in cloudwatch by default.

Thus we can save the log data as long as we want.

We can set retention for each log group at any time.

We can set log data for any terminated EC2 instance or Elastic load balancer after it's termination.
