Multi-AZ, backups and read replicas

Backups

Two types of backups

1. Automated backups

The retention period of it is from 1 to 35 days. You can take automated backup of snapshots and transaction logs everyday and when you do recovery , aws takes latest backups and applies latest transactionlogs to it and allow you to do point in time recovery.

Automated backups are enabled by default.

The backup data is stored in S3 and you get storage size equal to size of database.

Automated backup are done during a window and storage I/O may be suspended and you may experience latency.

If you delete the original RDS instance , your automated backups will also be deleted.

2. Database snapshots

This  is done manually by user and they are stored even after you delete original RDS instance


Whenever you restore your backup , it will be new RDS instance with new DNS endpoint

All the RDS instance, database and it's backup , read replicas are encryped

Excrypting present database is not supported.

To encrypt RDS instance, you need to make create snapshot , make copy of that snapshot and encrypt the copy
