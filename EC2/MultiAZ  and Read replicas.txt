MultiAZ  and Read replicas

MultiAZ allows you to have exact copy of your production database in another availability zone. Exact copy is maintained internally by AWS.

In case of failure , AWS RDS will automatically failover to standby.

MultiAZ is for disaster recovery only. It is not used for performance improvement.


Read replicas

Read only copy of your database.

It is replication for performance improvement

MultiAZ is synchronous and Read replicas are asynchronous.

Read replicas are available for
1. aurora
2. mariadb
3. Mysql
4. postgresql

Must have automatic backups turned on for read replicas

You can have 5 read replicas of database.

You can have read replicas of read replicas but there will be latency.

Eachread replica will have it's own DNS endpoint.

You can have read replicas that have multiAZ enabled.

You can create read replicas of MultiAZ database.

Replica can be promoted to be their database. this will break replication.

You can have read replica in another region as well.

You can encrypt read replica even if primary database is not encrypted.
