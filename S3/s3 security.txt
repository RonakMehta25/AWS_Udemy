s3 security

By default , all the buckets in S3 are private.

You can setup access to your bucket in the following ways:-

1. Using bucket policy . It applies at bucket level.

2. Using access control list . It applies at object level.

S3 can be configured to create logs which contains all the request made to it . This logs can be put in another bucket.

Bucket policies are written in JSON

Encryption is possible at bucket as well as object level.

We can't upload publicly accessible object to a private bucket.

While creating bucket , we can have bucket access logs as well as object level logs(cloudTrail)
