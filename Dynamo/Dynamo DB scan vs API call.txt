Dynamo DB scan vs Query API call

Query

Query is normal sql query which finds item based on some value.

Results returned by query are always sorted by sort key. It is ascending by default. 

Order can be changed by setting parameter ScanIndexForward to false

This queries are eventual consistent . It can be changed to Strong consistent 

Scan


Scan returns all item and data attribute which can be filtered by projectExpression.

But you can also use filter on scan

So the difference is it is applying filter after loading the entire table in memory which is not the case in query.


You can improve the response of query or scan by setting page size.

In order to improve the scan operation , you can use parallel scan . By default ,scan works on item sequentially.

It returns 1 MB of result before moving to the next 1 MB of data.

For Parallel Scan , You can divide partition into segment thus scanning each segment in Parallel.
