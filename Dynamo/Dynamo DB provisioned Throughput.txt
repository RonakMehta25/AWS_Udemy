Dynamo DB provisioned Throughput


Provisioned throughput is measured in Capacity Unity

When creating table , you have to specify your requirement as read capacity unit and write capacity unit if auto scaling is not turned on.

1 write capacity unit  = 1*1 KB per second

1 read capacity unit = 1 strong consistency of 4 KB or 2 eventual consistency of 4 KB. 

Eg 5 Read Capacity and 5 Write capacity table.

This configuration will be able to perform 

5 write capacity unit = 5 KB/second write

5 Strong consistency read= 5*4 = 20 KB/s strong consistency read

5 eventual consistency read= 2*5*4 = 40 KB/s eventual consistency read.

Calculating the requirement

1. suppose you have 80 item to read per second and each item is 3 KB and you only need strong consistency.
Then you can divide by 4 KB and multiple with number of items 

Here answer is 60 capacity unit without rounding off.
