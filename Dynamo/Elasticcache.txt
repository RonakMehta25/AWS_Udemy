Elasticache

Example : memcached and Redis

2 types of caching :-

1. Lazy Loading

2. Write through

1. Lazy Loading

It only loads the data when necessary. If there is miss in cache then application has to load the data in cache.
This means it can have stale data as it is not updated automatically.

We can add TTL to our data . It gives time till data can be kept . After the data expires , it has to query original database. Thus it has read penalty.

2. Write through

It updates the data in database as well as cache. Thus there is overhead of updating cache everytime. Thus it has write penalty

If the node fails then data will be missing in new node until data is updated or new data is added.
