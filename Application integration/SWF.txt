SWF


Amazon Simple Workflow Service (SWF) is a web service that makes it easy to coordinate work across distributed application components.

In Amazon SWF, tasks represent invocations of logical steps in applications. 

Tasks are processed by workers which are programs that interact with Amazon SWF to get tasks, process them, and return their results. A worker implements an application processing step. 

You can build workers in different programming languages and even reuse existing components to quickly create the worker.

To coordinate the application execution across workers, you write a program called the decider in your choice of programming language. 

The separation of processing steps and their coordination makes it possible to manage your application in a controlled manner and give you the flexibility to deploy, run, scale and update them independently.
